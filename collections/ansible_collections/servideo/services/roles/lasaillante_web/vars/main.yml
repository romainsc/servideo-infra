# List of container image to force in the service pod registration
# At least two images must be presents (build + pull) in order to trigger the use of the pod and not a single container.
# WORKAROUND: As the module try to pull, even the locally built images, the image list is a fake one until I set up a local registry
container_images_to_pull:
  - "quay.io/bitnami/mariadb:10.5.10"
  - "quay.io/bitnami/wordpress:5.7.2"

# Each item of this list will used as follow:
# * exposed_port: the port the container will expose inside the pod
# * protocol: the tcp or udp protocol.
# Both theses two values will be declared in the generated Dockerfile if image will be built.
# Then depending on the protocol a system wide (not user) systemd driven proxy will be registered and deployed:
# * ext_port: 
#   * The port that will be accessible from outsite, where the proxy will listen bound to {{ ext_ip_address }}
#   * This port will be opened on firewalld in the “public” zone.
#   * If non existant, then the port is only exposed internally to the pod
# * host_port: The port where the connection will be proxied to bound to localhost
# * Depending on the protocol, the system proxy will be:
#   * udp: socat
#   * tcp: internal systemd proxyd
